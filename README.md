# HFMCA_EEG
Official PyTorch implementation of Paper &lt;HFMCA: Orthonormal Feature Learning for EEG-based Brain Decoding>

# Overview
This repository contains the basic implementation of our proposed HFMCA (Hierarchical Functional Maximize Analyze) method for EEG-based brain decoding. HFMCA introduces orthonormal feature learning to enhance the representation quality of EEG signals for improved brain state classification.

# Repository Contents

Core Implementation: Basic HFMCA model architecture and loss functions we proposed

Supplementary Materials: Additional experimental results and implementation details

# Datasets
## SEED Dataset

Download from: [https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/home/seed/index.html]

Description: SJTU Emotion EEG Dataset (SEED)
## BCI Competition IV Dataset 2A

Download from: [https://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/]

Description: Motor Imagery EEG dataset from BCI Competition IV

Note: We provide data loading functions in the code, but the dataset needs to be downloaded separately

# Supplementary Materials

## Data Augmentation Methods

Detailed explanations of the data augmentation techniques used in our approach

## Ablation Studies
HFMCA architecture ablation experiments and results

# Work in Progress
⚠️ Note: This work is still in progress. We are continuously improving the code and adding more features. We will add a clean version (maybe in the format Jupyter notebook) later.
